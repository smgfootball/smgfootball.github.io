                Hello, I'm Veselin Penev from the 8th grade and I'm 15 years old. I have a big beard that makes me popular. I have a big brother with an even bigger beard
                and a big sister whom I love very much.
                I also have a very lovely girlfriend with whom we have been together for a year and a month.
                I have been studying at the Sofia Highschool of Mathematics "Paisiy Hilendarski" since the 5th grade. I am from Sofia and live there. I don't have many interests.
                I have been passionate about football since I was a child. I'm a Real Madrid fan
                but I also like other teams like liverpool, Napoli, Loko Sofia and others.
                I don't train professionally, I play often for fun and as a hobby. I am a fan of cats, with at least 10 cats/kittens in our yard.
                I can't live without music, with my favorite artists being Travis Scott, Yeat and the underrated Bulgarian Zhluch. I am interested in shoe and clothing brands,
                and my favorites are Nike and Off-White. My favorite car brand is Chevrolet and my favorite model is Camaro. I prefer PlayStation over Xbox.
                I like to go out with friends. I don't like sitting in home because there's nothing to do but play on the computer.
                I don't have a favorite subject in school because I'm not a fan of it. My favorite color is green or black, not sure. I don't like reading books. I can swim.
                I run fast. I don't know if I can fight because I haven't had to. In math, I prefer algebra to geometry.
                My favorite football player is Cristiano Ronaldo, but I also have sympathy for his eternal rival, Leo Messi. Programming is hard for me. Chemistry even more so.
                I am generally friendly, so it would be a pleasure to meet you.

                Hello, I'm Dimitar Stanimirov, 14 years old and I am from the 8th grade, being a student at Sofia High School of Mathematics
                "Paisiy Hilendarski" from this school year. I have been programming since
                2nd grade, when I started with a Scratch course in the first graduating class of SoftUni's children's lessons - SoftUni Kids.
                I did webdev there - HTML, CSS and Javascript for the first time in 3rd grade with Javascript being my first
                a real programming language.
                Since then I've made multiple websites, with one main one where I showcase my projects. You can
                see it <a href="https://giggiog.github.io">[here]</a>. Over the years I have programmed in many languages,
                but over time I have mainly concentrated on two. One is C++, which I use as in the competition
                informatics that I practice and for personal projects. The other language is Javascript, which I use not only
                client-side for websites, and server-side for servers, including for games. The games with the most
                I'm proud are <a href="https://github.com/GiggioG/igrata">Igrata</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/GiggioG/tank-tactics">Tank Tactics</a>. Although I have been programming since
                over six years now, this is the first year I have practiced it in school. That is, of course, if you do
                turn off the simple Scratch games from the 7th grade in my old school - 20 "Todor Minkov" Elementary School. I don't hate math, but I don't like it neither.
                I entered Sofia High School of Mathematics not so much because of math, but rather because of informatics.
                Of the narrative subjects, I like history the most, although no matter how interested I am in class, after That
                I don't remember anything on the tests. Of the "exact sciences" I hate chemistry the most, because no matter how much they try to make us think,
                8th grade chemistry is far from an exact science. It is full of rules, whose only
                explanation is "you will study it in 10th grade".
